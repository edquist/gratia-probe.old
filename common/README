Installing the Gratia probe clients -- general information
Version 0.9c
Penelope Constanta & Chris Green


We recommend that the client software be placed in the directory $VDT_LOCATION

1. Install the software:

  rpm -Uvh --relocate /opt/vdt/gratia="$VDT_LOCATION/gratia" \
      gratia-probe-common-<version>.noarch.rpm \


2. Install a specific probe such as gratia-probe-condor or
gratia-probe-psacct; or write your own based on samplemeter.pl or
samplemeter.py.


3. Customize the gratia ProbeConfig files for each probe, initializing
from ProbeTemplate if necessary. The following variables (at least)
should have appropriate values:

 ____________________________________________________________________________
|   Gratia Configuration Variable        |   Set value information           |
|________________________________________|___________________________________|
|MeterName="generic"                     |This value will be entered in the  | 
|                                        |database to indicate where the     |
|                                        |record came from.  We recommend a  |
|                                        |batchsystem:FQDN such as           |

|                                        |to which the head node give access.|
|                                        |This is used in particular in the  |
|                                        |report.                            |
|________________________________________|___________________________________|
|VDTSetupFile=                           |Path to the vdt setup.sh file.     |
|  "MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh"         |Please expand the                  |
|                                        |MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION variable.       |
