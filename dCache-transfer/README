This README describes the dCache transfer probe for Gratia.

This probe reports to Gratia the details of each file transfer into or out
of a dCache file server.  It gets this information from the dCache "billing"
database.

Unlike most other dCache probes, this one runs continuously in the background.

For performance reasons, sites with large dCache billing databases are advised
to alter the "billinginfo" table by adding an index on the pair of columns
    (datestamp, transaction)
and to alter the "doorinfo" table by adding an index on the (transaction)
column.  This should speed up the search for newly added records.

Here's the suggested indexes:

create index transaction on doorinfo(transaction);
create index dates_di on doorinfo(datestamp);
create index initiator on billinginfo(initiator);
create index dates on billinginfo(datestamp);

FILES AND DIRECTORIES:
=====================
This package is normally installed in
    $VDT_LOCATION/gratia/probe/dCache-transfer.
It comprises the following files:

README - this file that you are reading now.
Alarm.py - records error conditions and sends a warning email if there are
           too many errors.
Checkpoint.py - records the last record sent to Gratia.
CheckpointTest.py - a set of unit tests for Checkpoint.py.
DCacheAggregator.py - code that reads the billing db, packages it and
                      sends it to Gratia.
dCacheBillingAggregator.py - this is the main routine.
ProbeConfig - this is the Gratia configuration file. It tells the probe
              where to find the Gratia server, security setup, etc. See
	      the section "CONFIGURING THE PROBE", below, for more details.

In addition the RPM installs the file
  /etc/init.d/gratia-dcache-transfer
which starts the probe at boot time and shuts it down at shutdown time.
If you want to see if the probe is running, run this command with the
argument "status".

The probe has a checkpoint file in
  $VDT_LOCATION/gratia/var/data/chkpt_dcache_xfer_DoNotDelete
This tells it which record it last send to Gratia.

It logs messages to
  $VDT_LOCATION/gratia/var/logs/dcacheTransfer.log
The logs are rotated once they are more than 512KB. The previous 10 logs
are kept.

Messages from the Gratia transport system are logged to
  $VDT_LOCATION/gratia/var/logs/yyyy-mm-dd.log
where yyyy = the current year, mm = the current month and dd = the current day.
For example, 2008-03-12.log.

CONFIGURING THE PROBE:
=====================
Instructions for configuring the dCache Transfer Probe as installed from
an RPM or VDT package.

Edit the ProbeConfig file in this directory; you need to verify the values of:

SOAPHost                   The host running your local gratia repository.
DBHostName                 The fully qualified SRM DB Host name.
DBLoginName                The login name for the SRM DB.
DBPassword                 The password for the SRM DB.
DBName                     The name of the postgres database.
DCacheServerHost           The fully qualified hostname of your dCache server.
EmailServerHost            For problem emails -- SMTP server.
EmailFromAddress           For problem emails -- from address.
EmailToList                For problem emails -- recipient list.
DcacheLogLevel             Probe-specific logging level.
                           Valid values are debug, info, warn and error.
OnlySendInterSiteTransfers If true, ignore intra-site transfers.
                           Defaults to true.
EnableProbe                Set to 1 to enable the probe.

If no password is needed, use the empty string.

If installed via RPM, activate the probe using:

  chkconfig --add gratia-dcache-transfer
  service start gratia-dcache-transfer

If installed via VDT, configure-osg.sh should activate the probe;
otherwise ensure configuration with:

  $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gratia --probe dcache-transfer \
    --report-to <reporting-host> --site-name <OSG_SE_NAME> --probe-cron

  vdt-control --on gratia-dcache-transfer

UPGRADING:
=========
If you are upgrading, please make sure that the checkpoint file(s) 
are not lost or damaged. The upgraded installation will
need those file(s) to know which records have been sent to Gratia already.

TESTING:
=======
If you turned on Gratia dCache transfer probe you should be able to see the 
accounting information by accessing your Gratia collector. Keep in mind that 
storage probe collection is executed by a cron job, so check the time the cron 
job will be executed:

# cat /etc/cron.d/gratia-probe-dcache-storage.cron 
22 * * * * root "/opt/d-cache/gratia/probe/dCache-storage/dCache-storage_meter.cron.sh"

To access the information about Gratia dCache-transfer probe, 
go to http://<gratia_host>:<gratia_port>/gratia-reporting/, click on "Custom SQL Query" 
on the left site menu frame, enter the following query into provided text box:

select * from MasterTransferSummary where ProbeName like 'dcache-transfer:<dcache_admin_host_name>';

click on "Execute Query" and you will see the total number of transfer per user.
