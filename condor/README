Installing the Gratia Condor probe client
Version 0.9c
Penelope Constanta & Chris Green

We recommend that the client software be placed in the directory $VDT_LOCATION

1. Install the software:

  rpm -Uvh --relocate /opt/vdt/gratia="$VDT_LOCATION/gratia" \
      gratia-probe-common-<version>.noarch.rpm \
      gratia-probe-condor-<version>.noarch.rpm

	
2. Customize the gratia probe configuration file $VDT_LOCATION/gratia/probe/condor/ProbeConfig
	o Edit the ProbeConfig file so that the following variables have the 
	  correct values:

 ____________________________________________________________________________
|   Gratia Configuration Variable        |   Set value information           |
|________________________________________|___________________________________|
|MeterName="generic"                     |This value will be entered in the  | 
|                                        |database to indicate where the     |
|                                        |record came from.  We recommend a  |
|                                        |batchsystem:FQDN such as           |
|                                        |  'condor:fermigrid1.fnal.gov'     |
|________________________________________|___________________________________|
|SiteName="Generic Site"                 |This value use in the report to    | 
|                                        |refer to the site/farm/cluster     |
|                                        |to which the head node give access.|
|                                        |This is used in particular in the  |
|                                        |report.                            |
|________________________________________|___________________________________|
|VDTSetupFile=                           |Path to the vdt setup.sh file.     |
|  "MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh"         |Please expand the                  |
|                                        |MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION variable.       |

3. The RPM install procedure makes appropriate entries in root's crontab
for uploading accounting information to gratia at the appropriate
time. The time is appropriately randomized.


4. Under the directory gratia/condor-probes/gram_mods there are two
files that contain the changes to the Globus script. If gratia was
installed originally with VDT and the RPMS have been installed as
recommended under ${VDT_LOCATION}, nothing needs to be done. However, if
you get a post-install message regarding condor.pm and/or
managedfork.pm, please act upon that message.


5. The SOAPHost has been preconfigured to use the official OSG Gratia
collector: change at your own risk.
