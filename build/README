Probe area packaging build instructions.
----------------------------------------

1) The script package-probe will create tarfiles for each directory
mentioned. Example usage:

     build/package-probe 0.4.1 common condor psacct

2) These tarfiles should be moved into the SOURCES area of your
RPM build tree.

3) Use the RPM SPEC file in build/ to create the RPMs. Note that the
Version: tag must match the version used in the invocation of the
package-probe command (0.4.1 in the example above). An example command:

     rpmbuild -ba <spec-file>

   Don't forget to customize Version:, Release:, Vendor: and Packager: as appropriate.
