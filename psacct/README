Installing the Gratia Condor probe client
Version 0.b
Penelope Constanta & Chris Green

We recommend that the client software be placed in the directory $VDT_LOCATION

1. Install the software:

  rpm -Uvh --relocate /opt/vdt/gratia="$VDT_LOCATION/gratia" \
      gratia-probe-common-<version>.noarch.rpm \
      gratia-probe-psacct-<version>.noarch.rpm

	
2. Customize the gratia probe configuration file $VDT_LOCATION/gratia/probe/psacct/ProbeConfig
	o Edit the ProbeConfig file so that the following variables have the 
	  correct values:

 ____________________________________________________________________________
|   Gratia Configuration Variable        |   Set value information           |
|________________________________________|___________________________________|
|MeterName="generic"                     |This value will be entered in the  | 
|                                        |database to indicate where the     |
|                                        |record came from.  We recommend a  |
|                                        |batchsystem:FQDN such as           |

|                                        |refer to the site/farm/cluster     |
|                                        |to which the head node give access.|
|                                        |This is used in particular in the  |
|                                        |report.                            |

|  "MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh"         |Please expand the                  |
|                                        |MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION variable.       |

3. The RPM install procedure makes appropriate entries in root's crontab
for uploading accounting information to gratia at the appropriate
time. The time is appropriately randomized.

4. For testing, use SOAPHost="cd-psg2.fnal.gov:8881"; for production,
use SOAPHost="cd-psg2.fnal.gov:8882"
