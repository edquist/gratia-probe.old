Dear %%%SITE%%% site manager,

Your site has been determined to be at OSG version 0.6.0 or
higher, but according to our checks on %%%CHECK_DATE%%% does not appear
to be reporting properly to the official OSG Gratia accounting server,
http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880/gratia-reporting/.

Having a Gratia probe associated with the batch systems you have running
properly installed and reporting is required for OSG gatekeepers of
version 0.6.0 or greater.

Any probes we have seen in recent months associated with %%%SITE%%% are
listed below along with their last-seen date from the point of view of
the Gratia accounting collector:

### Begin probe list
%%%PROBE_LIST%%%
### End probe list

If this list contains entries that are no longer relevant, please let us
know and we will mark that probe inactive in our system.

If probes in this list are intended to be reporting, please follow the
trouble-shooting instructions at:

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Accounting/TroubleShootingInstructions

If the probe list is empty or does not include a probe for every batch
system (Condor, SGE, PBS or LSF) you run on your gatekeeper, please
install the appropriate package:

### Begin commands
. $VDT_LOCATION/seutp.sh
pacman -get Gratia-<probe>-Probe
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gratia --probe <probe-type> \
 --probe-cron --report-to gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880
vdt-control --on gratia-<probe-type>
### End commands

... where "<probe>" is "Condor", "SGE", "PBS" or "LSF" and
"<probe-type>" is the lower case version of "<probe>"

Then, check your configuration with the gratia-site-test script
available from the trouble-shooting page linked above.

A final note: your probes may be working correctly but not reporting a
site name consistent with the GOC-registered site name: we have been
able to catch some instances but probably not all. If %%%SITE%%% is the
GOC-registered name and you are reporting under a different name, please
let us know so that we may resolve the discrepancy.

Thank you for your time and help,

The OSG Gratia Team.
